git rebase: merges another branch into the branch where you are currently working,
and move all of the local commits that are ahead of the rebased branch to the top of the history on that branch.

To get the changes from master into your work branch, do:
 git rebase remote/master

To merge some_branch into master:

1) git checkout master
2) git pull origin master //Get all latest commits of master branch
3) git merge some_branch

Another option:
git checkout master && git pull && git branch -b <newbranch> && git merge <СтараяВеткаГдеМногоКомитов> --squash


git push origin branchname
origin  is an alias on your system for a particular remote repository.

Git has the concept of "remotes", which are simply URLs to other copies of your repository. When you clone another repository, git automatically creates a remote named "origin" and points to it.

You can see more info about the remote by typing

git remote show origin

Remotes are simply an alias that store the url of repositories. You can see what url belongs to each remote by using:

git remote -v
In the push command, you can use remotes or you can simply use a url directly. An example that uses the url

git push git@github.com:git/git.git master

remotes/origin/master is a branch named master on the remote named origin. You can refer to this as either origin/master, as in:

git diff origin/master..master

origin/master is "where master was over there last time I checked"
master is "where master is over here based on what I have been doing"

origin/master = backup of remote machine, updated last time you checked master = your copy of origin/master


git fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.
Due to it's "harmless" nature, you can rest assured: fetch will never manipulate, destroy, or screw up anything.

git pull, in contrast, is used with a different goal in mind: to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.

- Create account on GitHub
- Install Git Client for Windows
- Set up SSH keys <a href=https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/>SSH</a>
- Create Git project on PC using Git Bash:

mkdir C:\GITHUB\mlubinsky.github.com
cd C:\GITHUB\mlubinsky.github.com
git init
create and edit the file index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:mlubinsky:mlubinsky.github.com.git
git push -u origin master

To get local copy of git repo:
git clone git://github.com/mlubinsky/mlubinsky.github.com.git
<h2>GitHub Troubleshooting </h2>
Make sure your github repository host has the contents   of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh -vT git@github.com  - this command is helpful for git debugging

<b>Example of file ./git/config (pay attention to url = line) </b>
