## Time series


Time series problem is different from a regression problem in following ways:

1) The main difference is that a time series is time dependent. So the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent doesnâ€™t hold in this case.
2) Along with an increasing or decreasing trend, most Time Series have some form of seasonality trends,i.e. variations specific to a particular time frame.


 Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the mean of the absolute values of the errors.
