<h2>MVCC (MultiVersion Concurrency Control)</h2>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control
http://elliot.land/post/sql-transaction-isolation-levels-explained

If someone is reading from a database at the same time as someone else is writing to it, it is possible that the reader will see a half-written or inconsistent piece of data.
There are several ways of solving this problem, known as concurrency control methods.
The simplest way is to make all readers wait until the writer is done, which is known as a lock.
This can be very slow, so MVCC takes a different approach: each user connected to the database sees a snapshot of the database at a particular instant in time.
Any changes made by a writer will not be seen by other users of the database until the changes have been completed
(or, in database terms: until the transaction has been committed.)


The SQL standard tried to define four isolation levels (read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read and serializable)
- Read uncommitted permits dirty reads, non repeatable reads and phantom reads.
- Read committed permits non repeatable reads and phantom reads.
- Repeatable read permits only phantom reads.
- Serializable does not permit any read errors.    Client perform transactions in serial.
