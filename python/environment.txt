ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
-----------------------
https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables

PYTHONPATH
PYTHONHOME
PYTHON_BIN_PATH


PIP - python package manager   https://pypi.org/project/pip/
----

a) globally sudo  -H 
b) locally  pip install --user .   Install to the Python user install directory for your platform. Typically ~/.local/,
If you use --user option then package gets installed in user's folder. This can be found using:

python -m site --user-site   # Users/miclub01/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
python -m site --user-base   # /Users/miclub01/Library/Python/2.7

python -c 'import sys; print(sys.path)'  |  tr ',' '\n'
pip â€“version                 should point to same python

How python finds its modules . https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/
-----------------------------
import mymodule
When the interpreter executes the above import statement, 
it searches for mymodule.py in a list of directories assembled from the following sources:

1) The directory from which the input script was run or the current directory if the interpreter is being run interactively
2) The list of directories contained in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, if it is set. (The format for PYTHONPATH is OS-dependent but should mimic the PATH environment variable.)
3) An installation-dependent list of directories configured at the time Python is installed



A module is a single python file, while a package is a folder containing python files, 
accompanied by a (can be empty) file named __init__.py, to tell python it is a package to import modules from.

By default, Python looks for its modules and packages in $PYTHONPATH:

python -c "import os, sys; print(os.linesep.join(sys.path))" 

MODULES and PACKAGES
---------------------

__init__.py
python -m

SITE PACKAGES  
-------------
Most system packages are stored in a child directory of the path stored in sys.prefix
import sys
sys.prefix

Third-party packages installed using pip are typically placed in one of the directories 
pointed to by site.getsitepackages:

import site
site.getsitepackages()

Unix(pure python): prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
Unix (non-pure, may be C++): exec-prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT .   https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/
--------------------

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv  v1
source v1/bin/activate
echo $PATH
...
deactivate

TESTING
--------


http://pythonwise.blogspot.com/2015/01/python-m.html
  `if __name__ == "__main__":` constructs but, of course, many files simply use that to expose tests rather than useful functionality
